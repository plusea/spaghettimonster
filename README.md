# spaghettimonster

The spaghettimonster is a tool we developed for playing with wearable technology first, before making it yourself. It is basically a breakout board for an ESP32 Dev Module with six audio sockets connected to pins that have an Analog to Digital Converter (ADC). This allows one to then use audio cables to make electrical connections between the i/o pins of the ESP and textile/wearable sensors mounted around the body or in/on puppets or objects. Spaghettimonster babies are little breakout boards for audio sockets so that one can make connections with conductive thread from the socket to the textile sensor.
